#+TITLE: TODO

* Now

- Refactor controller so inserting into database is separate (probably)
- Return URI from POST, not ID
- Convert with emacs/pandoc/whatever to pretty HTML
- Use IMGUR-style URL => need translation layer between hash thing and autoincrement ID. Or something else

* Later

- Add auth/login (required for public release)
- Frontend
