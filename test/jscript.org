#+TITLE: Testing script injection
* This is a test to see if script injection would happen with my website.
  Just send this to my API and see if Javascript becomes embedded in my site

  With code tags:

  #+BEGIN_SRC 
<script>
alert("hello stupid");
</script>

  #+END_SRC

  Without them:

  <script>
  alert("hello stupid");
  </script>
